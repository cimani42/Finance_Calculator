# Finance_Calculator
Simple user finance calculator, finding return on investment for simple or compound interest or repayment of bond payments.

This is a simple project covering some of the foundationary concepts that I have learned to code
in Python: Numerical and String Data types; Beginner Control Structures and Locical Programming Operators. 

The program allows the user to access two financial calculator; Investment Calculator and 
Loan Repayment Calulator. 
The user is encouraged to enter their financial information having used the 'input()' function.
Having used this, I would have to consider the reponses that might occur from the user, dealing 
with case sensitivity when applying logical operations; while also considering how to change the
data type. E.g., String to 'int' or 'float'. 

I used 'if', 'elif' and 'else' for the control structures. While this is useful for the simple 
calculators, it is limited when dealing with unexpected responses, as there is no prompt to
start the program again. The user is required to re-run the code to get to the intended result.
